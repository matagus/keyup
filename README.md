## Rationale

ClickUp is a great tool for managing tasks and projects. However, the web interface can be slow and cumbersome to use.
KeyUp! is a simple console-based client written in Python that allows you to quickly view any list of tasks without
leaving the terminal.

It makes use of [python-inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer) for interactive navigation of the ClickUp
teams, spaces, and lists. And it also accepts command line arguments to quickly navigate to a specific list for a given
team.

## Roadmap

* ~~Add interactive navigation of workspaces, spaces, and lists~~
* Add task viewing, creation, editing, and deletion
* Add tasks comments
