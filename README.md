## Rationale

ClickUp is a great tool for managing tasks and projects. However, the web interface can be slow and cumbersome to use.
KeyUp! is a simple console-based client written in Python that allows you to quickly view any list of tasks without
leaving the terminal.

## Roadmap

* Add interactive navigation of workspaces, spaces, and lists
* Add task viewing, creation, editing, and deletion
* Add tasks comments
